There is one which gives a ridge regression and neural network model, trained and tested on data from the ATom 1 mission.

Another which examines the causality within the dataset, using Judea Pearl's DoWhy package.

The last uses the ridge regression model to examine how OH varies across the globe, using UKCA data as input.
